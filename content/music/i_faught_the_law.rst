愛上這首歌是因為以前剛接觸搖滾樂時聽了The Clash的CD，簡單有力的節奏跟朗朗上口的歌詞，一下就很容易引起共鳴。

現場版本還是比較好聽 (1979) 。

最早這首歌Sonny Curtis在1958年寫的，後來加入The Crickets，1960年初次出現在唱片 *In Style with the Crickets* , 鄉村風味濃厚。 (The Crickets是Boddy Holly 1959去世後變成Sonny Curtis主導的樂團。)

但是真的唱出名是Bobby Fuller Four的版本 (1965)，變成比較搖滾，也是後來The Clash之後很多龐克樂團的翻唱都是那這個當範本。

後來就是一大堆搖滾跟龐克樂團跟著翻唱，Bruce Springsteen, Greatful Dead, Green Day... 太多了，大家自行去搜尋。

Dead Kennedys改唱的是: I fought the law, and **I** won. (唯一有贏的!)

I Fought the Law:: 

  Breaking rocks in the hot sun
  I fought the law and the law won
  I fought the law and the law won
  I needed money cause I had none
  I fought the law and the law won
  I fought the law and the law won
   
  I miss my baby and I feel so bad
  I guess my race is run
  Well she's the best girl that I've ever had
  I fought the law and the law won
  I fought the law and the law won
   
  Robbing people with a six gun
  I fought the law and the law won
  I fought the law and the law won
   
  I miss my baby and the good fun
  I fought the law and the law won
  I fought the law and the law won
   
  I miss my baby and I feel so bad
  I guess my race is run
  Well she's the best girl that I've ever had
  I fought the law and the law won
  I fought the law and the law won
